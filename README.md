# FirstHTMLandCSSWebsite_26JAN2021
Created this website with HTML and CSS on 26 January 2021. 

I followed a video tutorial by Traversy Media (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdI2bqOjy3c) on a crash course for CSS. 

Coincidentally, this is also Day 3 of my #100DaysofCode Challenge. 

Cheers,

Jay.
